Welcome to firstClass! This repo is a growing collection of LaTeX 
classes and scripts to automate compilation.

## Dependencies

* [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)
* Unix terminal/environment: Git Bash, Terminal, Putty, etc

## Features

**Industry Resume**: Are you tired of starting from scratch when 
creating customized resumes per company or institution? What if 
one could modularize a resume's contents? Some sections may remain
fixed while others can vary slightly. Imagine an update to your 
education or job experience that needs to be applied across dozens of 
resumes. The links below contain the underlying script, a snapshot 
of the resume template, and a step-by-step walkthrough example.

* [Script](scripts/make_resume.sh)

documents.
